Constructs a basis for the coefficient vectors `t⁽ⁿ⁾` that span the space of Hermitian (or
`antihermitian` if `true`) TB Hamiltonians `Hₛₜ(k) = vᵢ(k) Mᵢⱼₛₜ tⱼ = vᵀ(k) M⁽ˢᵗ⁾ t`.
We do this by assuming that each coefficient vector `t` is sorted into a vector of the
form `[tᴿ; itᴵ]` so that we can take the complex conjugate by as `t* = σ₃t`, which can
then be moved onto `M⁽ˢᵗ⁾` instead of `t`. The constraint `Hₛₜ(k) = (H†)ₛₜ(k) = Hₜₛ*(k)`
can then be expressed as `vᵀ(k) M⁽ˢᵗ⁾ tⱼ = v*ᵀ(k) M⁽ᵗˢ⁾ σ₃ t = vᵀ(k) (Pᵀ M⁽ᵗˢ⁾σ₃) t`,
which requires that `t` be a solution to the nullspace `M⁽ˢᵗ⁾ - Pᵀ M⁽ᵗˢ⁾ σ₃ = 0`. We
cast this as `Z - Q = 0`, with `Z = M⁽ˢᵗ⁾` and `Q = Pᵀ M⁽ᵗˢ⁾ σ₃`.

## notes
For anti-Hermitian symmetry, we require `Hₛₜ(k) = -Hₜₛ*(k)`, which translates to
`M⁽ˢᵗ⁾ + Pᵀ M⁽ᵗˢ⁾ σ₃ = 0`; i.e., simply swaps the sign of `Q`
