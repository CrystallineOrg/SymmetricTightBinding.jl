# TRS can be understood as a spatial symmetry when acting on the Hamiltonian:
#   `D(ùíØ)H(k)D(ùíØ)‚Ä† = H(ùíØk) -> Œì(ùíØ)H*(k)Œì(ùíØ)‚Ä† = H(-k)`, where `D` is the whole 
# operator and `Œì` is only the unitary part, so `D(ùíØ) = Œì(ùíØ)ùíØ`
# If the basis of the representation is real, `Œì(ùíØ) = I -> H*(k) = H(-k)`. We will
# assume this is the case from now on.

# NB: The "realification" of the representation is performed in Crystalline.jl when 
# time-reversal symmetry is present.

# We have that `H·µ¢‚±º(k) = v·µÄ(k) M·µ¢‚±º t`. Remember that we split `t` into real and imaginary
# parts: `t = [real(t); i imag(t)]`, and `Mm` acts as `[Mm Mm]`. Then, we can rewrite
# the Hamiltonian as:
#   `H·µ¢‚±º(k) = v·µÄ(k) [M·µ¢‚±º M·µ¢‚±º] [real(t); i*imag(t)]`

# Then, applying TRS will be:

# 1. `H(-k) = v·µÄ(-k) [M·µ¢‚±º M·µ¢‚±º] [real(t); i*imag(t)]`

# 2. `H*(k) = (v*)·µÄ(k) [M·µ¢‚±º M·µ¢‚±º] [real(t); -i*imag(t)] = (v*)·µÄ(k) [M·µ¢‚±º -M·µ¢‚±º] [real(t); i*imag(t)]
# = `v·µÄ(-k) [M·µ¢‚±º -M·µ¢‚±º] [real(t); i*imag(t)]`

# where we make use of the fact that `v*(k) = v(-k)`.

# Imposing the condition `H(-k) = H*(k)` we get:
#   `v·µÄ(-k) [M·µ¢‚±º M·µ¢‚±º] [real(t); i*imag(t)] = v·µÄ(-k) [M·µ¢‚±º -M·µ¢‚±º] [real(t); i*imag(t)]`
# which can be rewritten as:
#   `v·µÄ(-k) [0 2M·µ¢‚±º] [real(t); i*imag(t)] = 0`

# This way of casting the problem is very convenient (and doesn't require any modification of 
#  the `v` vectors to include "reversed" hoppings, which is not in general a necessary feature).
# We just need to ensure that we intersect the `[real(t); i*imag(t)]` basis with the null space
# of  `[0 2M·µ¢‚±º]`.
