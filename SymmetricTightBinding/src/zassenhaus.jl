# implementation of the Zassenhaus algorithm.

using RowEchelon: rref!

# my idea is to have U and W as the matrices `{aᵢⱼ}` and `{bᵢⱼ}` from the Zassenhaus algorithm
# `U` is a matrix of `n×m` and `W` is a matrix of `k×m`.

    zassenhaus_intersection(U::AbstractArray{<:Number}, W::AbstractArray{<:Number}) 
        --> AbstractArray{<:Number}

Finds the intersection of two bases `U` and `W` using the Zassenhaus algorithm.
It assumes that the basis are given by columns.
